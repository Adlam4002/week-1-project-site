Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

I found using felxbox a lot easier today then I did previously. hopefully its due to having time to get my head aropund it between sessions.
I used HTML and CSS to create and style a website based on an example I was provided with. When setting up my page I used elements that were appropriate for what i was doing. For headings and statements that I wanted to stand out I used h3/2 tags. I used nav tags to set up my navigation links at the top of the page. I used header, main, and footer to make the overall structure easy to manage. I also used section and div throughout my page where i felt it was appropriate.
When it came to layout, I had to have one page with three large ‚Äúscreen‚Äù sized sections. I used flex-box to make organising the internal elements easier. This allowed me to get them exactly where I wanted them relatively quickly. I assigned classes to many of my elements so that I could keep my styling consistent. I decided to remove default margins from my elements, so I had more control over where they were in relation to each other. Once again flex-box helped me to position my elements correctly in each section. I used absolute positioning to make sure my copyright bar was on the bottom of the page.

As I wanted my elements to be roughly centred but not actually in the middle of the page I decided to use padding. Depending on where I wanted my elements on the page made classes with specific padding settings. I then added that class to which ever elements I wanted to apply that styling to.

For each main section of the website, I wanted to use a different background image. I found the images I wanted to use online then set them as the background in each section. I tried to use images that I felt suited a bank as I made a fictional banking company. I used a grand building, a cityscape, and an image of a vault to keep them on theme. I also tried to select images that were all fairly dark so that I could outline my text with a light colour to ensure it was readable no matter which part of the site you were looking at.

I think that I was able to achieve all the goals set out in this project, as I think my website is similarly structed to the example and I have included the functionality of the navigation. I don‚Äôt think the project task was particularly difficult as it was more of a consolidation of things we have learned and practised during the week. Rather than being hard it was a useful opportunity to tie in everything we learned during the sessions. As I write this I have a few extra stretch goal I‚Äôm considering implementing which involve using JS on the page.

I had a few glaces at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ while implementing my own flex-box usage. I used it to remind myself what each quality would change.
I also refered back to my own code that I had written during the week's earlier sessions.
